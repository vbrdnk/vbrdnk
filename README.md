## Hi, Vlad is here 👨🏻‍💻

I'm a Senior Engineer with over 7 years of experience working at both fast-paced startups and well-established IT companies.

I'm passionate about developing user-oriented software while adhering to industry best practices and leveraging the latest technologies.

I work at [Spotify](https://www.lifeatspotify.com/)

Neovim and terminal enthusiast. Probably spend too much time tweaking my configs.
